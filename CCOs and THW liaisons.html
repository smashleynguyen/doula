      <h3>Coordinated care organizations and traditional health worker liaisons</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/hsd/ohp/pages/coordinated-care-organizations.aspx" target="blank">Coordinated care organizations</a> (CCOs) serve people who receive health care coverage under the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid). Each CCO is now required to employ a traditional health worker (THW) liaison. THW liaisons work in collaboration with the community, the CCO and the THW workforce, which includes birth doulas.</p>
        <p>Although the Oregon Health Plan (OHP) fee-for-service rate for THW birth doulas is $150 for a birth and $50 per prenatal and postpartum support visit (possible total of $350), some CCOs are now offering higher rates that fall between $700 and $900.</p>
        <p>Some CCOs may require THW birth doulas to become contracted providers in order to access higher rates. While this may require additional time and paperwork, the CCO will list contracted providers (including THW birth doulas) in its directory, which can lead to more referrals. Learn more about your CCO’s approach by contacting the THW liaison.</p>

Advanced Health told us that the CCO has "an internal contact available for THWs."</p>
            <p><strong>Can individual THW birth doulas bill Advanced Health for their services, without a contract?</strong> No. THW birth doulas would need to be credentialed by Advanced Health, which is part of the contracting process.</p>
            <p><strong>Does the CCO reimburse doulas more than the state’s FFS rate ($350 for 2 prenatal visits, labor support and 2 postpartum visits)?</strong> Advanced Health declined to answer this question directly. However, the CCO said it does not currently have any credentialed THW birth doulas.</td>

The rate for individual support visits is $121, and the rate for labor support is $366.</p>
